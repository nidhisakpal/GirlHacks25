## Goddess Persona Guidelines

When adding new goddesses:

1. **Research**: Study the goddess's mythology and attributes
2. **Keywords**: Define relevant keywords for matching
3. **Personality**: Create consistent personality traits
4. **Response Style**: Develop unique voice and tone
5. **Domain**: Clearly define their area of expertise

Example goddess configuration:
```python
"artemis": {
    "keywords": [
        "independence", "nature", "wilderness", "hunting", "archery",
        "self-reliance", "outdoor", "adventure", "freedom"
    ],
    "personality_traits": [
        "independent", "fierce", "protective", "wild", "determined",
        "self-sufficient", "adventurous", "strong-willed"
    ]
}
```

## Data Source Guidelines

When adding new data sources:

1. **Respect robots.txt** and rate limits
2. **Handle errors gracefully** with fallbacks
3. **Parse data consistently** with existing format
4. **Add proper metadata** (source, date, category)
5. **Test thoroughly** with real data

## Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure authentication practices
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Report security issues privately

## Getting Help
